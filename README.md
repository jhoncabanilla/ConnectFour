# ConnectFour
Connect Four Game - In this project I've wanted to recreate the famous Connect Four game that we all know.
I've uploaded two versions:
- *conecta4.py*: With this code you can play the game using the terminal due to there is no an User Interface implemented yet.
- *conecta4_pygame*: Final version of the game. Theres is a basic UI implemented using [**pygame**](https://www.pygame.org/news).

Later on, the project will be improved by making use of **AI**.
